# Botbot
This is a chatbot application built using the Python programming language and the Tkinter GUI toolkit. The chatbot is capable of responding to various types of messages including greetings, farewells, expressions of gratitude, small talk, and requests for the current time. The user can type in a message in the input field and then click the "Send" button to send the message to the chatbot. The chatbot then analyzes the message and determines the appropriate response based on the type of message received. The response is then displayed in the chat window. The application also includes a scrollbar to allow the user to scroll through the chat history.
